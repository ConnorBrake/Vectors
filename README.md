# **Vectors.java**
A simple vectors simulation that harnesses the power of the Princeton made StdDraw.java class. 

## Currently, the simulation supports:
- Unit Vectors
- Position Vectors
- Resultant Vectors of Position Vectors
- The Alpha, Cosine, and Gamma Angles of Position Vectors
- Customizable Cartesian plane Demensions
- Dynamic Movement of Vectors on a the xy-plane

## Features 
- **Unit Vectors** - Represent vectors with a magnitude of 1 in any direction
  
- **Positon Vectors** - Represent vectors with any magnitude in any direction

## Prerequisite 
- Java JDK 8 (or higher)

## Future Features
- Labeled Axis, Vectors, and Angles
- Direction Vectors
- The xz-plane and yz-plane
- Projection of Vectors
