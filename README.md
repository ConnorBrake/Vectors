#**Vectors.Java**
A simple vectors simulation that harnesses the power of the Princeton made StdDraw.Java class. 

##Currently, the simulation supports:
- Unit Vectors
- Position Vectors
- Resultant Vectors of Position Vectors
- Customizable Cartesian plane Demensions
- Dynamic and Static Movement of Vectors on a the xy-plane

##Features 
- **Unit Vectors** - Represent vectors with a magnitude of 1 in any direction
  
- **Positon Vectors** - Represent vectors with any magnitude in any direction
  
- **Custom Cartesian Planes** - Represent a Cartesian plane with custom lengths
  

##Prerequisite 
- Java JDK 8 (or higher)
